## Description
This is a Responsive arcade script written in PHP that is -- in spirit -- based on the old (no longer 
supported or maintained) version of GameSiteScript 4. Nearly all of the code has been rewritten for 
better adherence to new coding standards.  A production "demo" of the front-end is always available at 
[Free Online Flash Games](https://www.phparcade.com).  Follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/phparcade) or
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/PHPArcade-271750579558482) for regular updates.
